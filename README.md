#### Some example about HDL
##### Ex1: Control circuit for 8 LEDs gradually lighting up and then dimming down. Adjustable frequency (one button to increase frequency and one button to decrease frequency). One button to allow pause/resume

##### Ex2: The traffic light control circuit, with time displayed on a 7-segment LED, where the input frequency is 1Hz, the green light is on for 15s, the yellow light is on for 5s, and the red light is on for 20s

##### Ex3: Design an automatic circuit to count up from 00 to 99 and then count down from 99 to 00, displaying on two 7-segment LEDs, continuously looping, with a push button allowing counting/start and stop counting
